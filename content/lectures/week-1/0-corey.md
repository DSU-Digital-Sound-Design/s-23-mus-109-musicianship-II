# Introduction

## Audio attributes and their associated implementations

- Spectral balance—parametric equalization
- Spatial attributes—delay and reverberation
- Dynamic range control—compression/limiting and expansion
- Sounds or qualities of sound that can detract from recordings—distortion and noise

## Goals of the book and software

1. To facilitate isomorphic mapping of technical parameters and perceived qualities of sound. Isomorphic mapping is a linking of technical and engineering parameters to auditory perceptual attributes. Engineers need to be able to diagnose problematic sonic artifacts in a recording and have an understanding of their causes. In audio, engineers are translating between physical control parameters \(i.e., frequency in Hertz, sound level in deci- bels\) and the perception of an audio signal \(i.e., timbre, loudness\).
2. To heighten awareness of subtle features and attributes of sound, and to promote a greater ability to differentiate among minute changes in sound quality or signal processing.
3. To increase the speed with which one can identify features of sound, translate between auditory perceptions and signal processing control parameters, and decide on what physical parameters need to be changed in a given situation.
