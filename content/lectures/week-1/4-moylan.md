## Why Audio Professionals Need to Evaluate Sound

> What are some methods you already use to evaluate sound? Why are they useful?

> Why do audio professionals need to evaluate sound? Does it depend on the position one has in the industry?

For the sound recordist:

1. keep track of oneâ€™s work so that the audio professional can return to those thoughts/activities in the future,
2. plan recording projects out of the studio,
3. understand the work and ideas of others,
4. recreate sounds and musical styles, and many more.

> What about as a way to help aid communication between people working with different aspects of sound?

> What are the steps one goes through when trying to understand sound?

1. perceiving sound through active attention
2. listener must know what to listen for
3. and where they can find that information

## Talking About Sound

Once one understands sound, then they can communicate about sound.

> Is there an agreed upon vocabulary for communicating about sound? Remember, we're not talking about music in this class. There's a very well established framework for talking about music, ie Western Music Theory.

What we have is a collection of impressive terms that associate perceptions and experiences to sound. We speak in metaphors.

> What are some of the ways you've heard of for speaking about sound like this? Ie crispy, dark, bright etc. What are some issues with these terms?

Some obvious issues with the above terms is that they mean different things to different people, they're subjective, not objective.

Even describing something as sounding like a specific instrument can be fraught with issues depending on the person's history with that instrument.

A worse way of categorizing sound than the above are by a sounds "mood" because they can be so much more subjective and dependant on culture and upbringing.

> What kind of music is "somber" to you, or "happy"? Does it have to do with the production quality or the musical content?

Because of this subjective nature of sound description we need a way to communicate about the sound itself. "Meaningful communication about sound will not be precise and relevant without such a description."

"Meaningful communication between individuals is possible when the actual, physical dimensions of sound are described through defining the activities of its component parts."

> Meaningful communication about sound can be accomplished through describing the values and activities of the physical states of sound. Sounds will be described by the characteristics that make them unique. Meaningful information about sound can be communicated through verbally describing the values and activities of the physical states of sound in a general way. Information is communicated in a more detailed and precise manner through graphing the activity, as will be explored and described in the following chapters.
