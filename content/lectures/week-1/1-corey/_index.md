## What is technical ear training?

> Technical Ear Training - a type of perceptual learning focused on timbral, dynamic, and spatial attributes of sound as they relate to audio recording and production.

{{% note %}}

These skills allow us to talk about sound in a more concrete and consistent way. One of the things we'll learn through focused practice is how to identify sounds and sound qualities that were originally indistinguishable.

## Timbre

- Spectral content. All frequencies present in a sound.
- Spectral balance. The relative balance of individual frequencies or frequency ranges.
- Amplitude envelope. Primarily the attack (or onset) and decay time of the overall sound, but also that of individual overtones.

_Timbral ear training_ focuses on identifying sounds by their timbre.

> Timbre is typically defined as that characteristic of sound other than pitch or loudness, which allows a listener to distinguish two or more sounds. Timbre is a multidimensional attribute of sound and depends on a number of physical factors such as the following:

For example, [here](https://cambridge-mt.com/rs2/lmp/acoustic-bass-01/) are recordings of a bass with microphones at different positions. A recording engineer will use their ears to determine which one sounds better for a certain situation.

## TET Focus

- Equalization and filtering
- Reverberation and delay
- Dynamics processing
- Characteristics of the stereo image

Technical ear training focuses on the features, characteristics, and sonic artifacts that are produced by various types of signal processing commonly used in audio engineering, such as the following:

- Equalization and filtering
- Reverberation and delay
- Dynamics processing
- Characteristics of the stereo image

### Isomorphic Mapping

> One of the primary goals of this book is to facilitate isomorphic mapping of technical and engineering parameters to perceptual attributes; to assist in the linking of auditory perceptions with control of physical properties of audio signals.

{{% note %}}

One has to have a deep understanding of not only the frequencies and their relationships, but also what a specific control on the EQ will do in different situations.

### Increasing Awareness

> The second goal of technical ear training is to increase our awareness of subtle details of sound and develop our ability to discern and identify by ear minute changes in physical parameters.

The more we practice, the more we'll be able to hear that we couldn't before, because we weren't listening for it.

Decisions one might make in the recording process:

- Microphone model, location, and orientation for each instrument being recorded.
- Preamplifier model and gain settings for each microphone.
- Recording level—which must be set high enough to reduce noise and quantization error, and low enough to avoid overloading a gain stage.
- Equalizer model and specific equalization parameter settings for each microphone signal.
- Noise—which can take many forms but in general is any sound that is not intended to be part of a recording. Examples include clicks/pops produced by analog or digital electronics, tape hiss, quantization error, air handling noise (which can be in the form of a low rumble and therefore not immediately apparent), external and environmental sounds such as traffic and subways, 50- or 60-Hz buzz or hum.
- Timbral quality—primarily frequency content and spectral balance. Every analog component from the microphone to the input of the recording device, as well as every stage of analog to digital conversion and re-quantization will have some effect on the timbral quality of audio. Dynamic range and dynamics processing—sound, musical or otherwise, will have a certain range from loud (fortissimo) to soft (pianissimo), and this range can be altered through dynamics processing, such as compressors and expanders.
- Balancing or mixing levels of recorded microphone signals.
- Spatial characteristics—includes reverberation, echo, reflections, delays, as well as panning and positioning of sound sources within the stereo or surround image.

### Increasing Speed of Detection

> the third goal is to increase the speed with which we can identify and decide on appropriate engineering parameters to change.

Timbre can be the most important aspect of a recording.

Can you think of a record where timbre plays a more important aspect than the musical content?

> Timbre has become such an important factor in recorded music that it can be used to identify a song before musical tonality or melody can have time to develop sufficiently. In their article titled “Name That Tune: Identifying Popular Recordings from Brief Excerpts,” Schellenberg et al. (1999) found that listeners could correctly identify pieces of music when presented with excerpts of only a tenth of a second in length.
