**Mono** was the only format of early popular music recordings. Stereo (with its two independent chan­nels) established a presence in the mid-1960s, and quickly dominated the market; initially two independent mixes were created: first for mono and an after-thought mix in stereo. Stereo is currently the default commercial format, and mono versions are now typically reductions of the stereo to a single channel. ‘Collapsed’ or ‘folded-down stereo’ merge the two channels of stereo into mono; this results in phase cancellations and other anomalies that alter the track, sometimes considerably. Mono records can be reproduced over two channel systems (sending the same information to both speakers producing “mirrored mono”) or over a single loudspeaker; these appear as either the center speaker of Figure 8.1 or the combined left plus right speakers.

**Stereo and surround sound** playback formats locate sources very differently in relation to the point of audition. The listener is presented with sound arriving from different directions, different number of directions, and listening cues differ between the two formats, altering percepts. Each format provides a very different experience, with striking differences to source localizations, width and depth, and artistic treatments of sources; they shape the artistic statement of the track in very different ways.
