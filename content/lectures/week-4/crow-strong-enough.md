title: "Sheryl Crow - Strong Enough Analysis"
---

Parameters: overall bandwidth, spectral balance, auditory image, spatial impression, dynamic range, noise/distortion, balance of components

- Well balanced instrumental parts that complement each other
  - What exactly does this mean?
- Numerous auditions of the track are required to identify all the sounds that are present.
  - Let's listen several times and try to pick out as many different elements as possible
- The piece starts with a synthesizer pad followed by two acoustic guitars panned left and right.
  - What category of analysis does panning the guitars left and right fall into? (Auditory Image)
- The guitars are less crisp than a typical acoustic guitar recording
  - On the spectrogram we can see that there isn't a lot of high frequency content on the guitars.
  - Let's listen to a few other recordings of acoustic guitars to compare:
  - [Acoustic Guitar](https://cambridge-mt.com/rs2/lmp/acoustic-guitar-01/)
- Lead vocals: enter with a dry and intense sound
  - Why analysis category does "dry" refer to? Answer: Spatial impression
  - Little reverb, bright timbre. Do we think Corey is referring to the timbre of the reverb itself?
  - What are some other vocal performances you can think of that have more reverb with a similar style of music?
  - See [Billie Elish - TV](https://music.apple.com/us/album/tv/1635388716?i=1635388718)
- A crisp, clear 12-string comes in contrasting with the dull sound of the other two guitars.
  - [Simon and Garfunkel - A hazy shade of winter](https://music.apple.com/us/album/bookends/203303421)

- Fretless electric bass enters to round out the lower pitches.
  - This happens at the same time
  - think of how different this bass instrument sounds from a typical electric bass with frets. Does this also sound different than an acoustic bass?
  - [Graceland by Paul Simon on Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/graceland/529574560?i=529574613)
- Hand percussion is panned left and right to fill out the spatial component of the stereo image.
  - What do you hear in the left speaker verses the right? One higher, wood blocky sort of sound and a lower sound that is hard to discern.
- The chorus features a fairly dry ride cymbal and
- a high, flutey Hammond B3 sound fairly low in the mix.
- After the chorus a pedal steel enters and then fades away before the next verse.
- The bridge features bright and clear, strumming mandolins that are panned left and right. Backing vocals, panned left and right, echo Crow’s lead vocal.
- How does the song maintain a coherency despite the variety of instruments involved?
