title: "Final Analysis Paper Instructions"
---

This paper will compare and contrast the recording from previous five listening journals. Pick at least three to discuss in the paper. Topics can include anything we've covered in the semester so far. For a review of analysis topics see this presentation: [Analysis of sound.](https://dsu-digital-sound-design.github.io/s-23-mus-109-musicianship-II/lectures/week-3/7-corey/#/)

You may reuse and revise some of your original writing. Your earlier analysis should be heavily revised with your current understanding at this point in the class. Create diagrams to demonstrate the similarities and differences between your chosen recordings. You should create at least two different types of diagrams (frequency plot, holistic sound stage, stereo image graph) and several versions to visually show differences between the recordings. Aim for around six diagrams total.

Reference these diagrams in the text of your paper using figure numbers. Also, when describing anything in your paper include a reference to the time in the recording.

Requirements:

- Length - 1,000 words
- Figures - Two diagram types from the three we learned (Frequency plot, Holistic sound stage, Stereo image graph)
- Uncompressed (WAV, FLAC, etc) recordings used for analysisâ€”no MP3s
- Reaper files used for analysis
