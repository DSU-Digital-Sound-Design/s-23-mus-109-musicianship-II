# Instructions

Do an aural analysis of a commercially available audio production.

1. Submit a three-paragraph analysis, along with a representative
   sound example. If you don't have the recording downloaded, a streaming link is ok.
2. Be prepared to discuss the production and your analysis of it in a 5-minute
   in-class presentation for each week.

# Context

As audio engineers, we constantly seek to improve our skills by
aural analysis of existing audio productions. The idea is to get into
the habit of listening to and learning to appreciate as many musical
works, genres, and recordings as possible. Learn to pay particular
attention to aspects of recording and production (in addition to
musical aspects such as harmony, melody, counterpoint, rhythm,
etc.). Do research on how a producer or engineer achieved or might
have achieved a certain effect.
If you practice these skills as part of your everyday exposure
to music, you will, over time, learn to distinguish the sound of different instruments, recording environments, microphones, audio
effects, recording media, etc. Above all, it will help you develop
your taste.

# Guidelines

There is generally something to be learned from both, good and
bad recordings. For this assignment, however, I would like you to
analyze a piece of music, which you particularly _like_ for the quality
of its production. This assignment’s purpose is to complement this emotional
appreciation by some professional awareness as to how it might
have been achieved. Another objective is to communicate such
awareness to your peers using the professional language of the
trade.

## General Guidelines

- Limit your discussion to a single piece of music (e.g., a song, not
  an album). Write three paragraphs about that piece.
- Create a short (30 seconds max.) sound example that contains a
  representative excerpt from the production of your choice.
- To the best of your ability, focus your discussion on aspects
  related to recording and production (rather than discussing the
  piece’s harmony, rhythm, lyrics, etc.).

## Background information

Both your analysis and the actual presentation should provide
essential background information about the production as a brief
introduction:

- When was this recorded?
- Who were the performing musicians, producer, and engineer?

## Aural Analysis

The focus of your presentation and analysis should be devoted to
an aural analysis. Use The European Broadcast Union's [Assessment methods for the subjective evaluation of the quality of sound programme material – Music](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3286.pdf) to guide your analysis. See appendix B for parameters and sub parameters. Corey (Chapter 7 - Analysis of Sound from Electroacoustic Sources) used these parameters to analyze recordings. He gives more detailed explanations of the terms in his book. Use his writing as inspiration. Below are some further questions that you might answer:

- Is the recording using one of the sound parameters in an original way?
- Which aspect of the production works particularly well and why?
- If you do not know where to start, focus on the first element that
  attracts your aural attention. Does the room in which the song
  has been recorded sounds unique? Or, is there is a transition
  from verse to chorus where the voice suddenly sounds very
  different? Focus
  on sounds that suggests the use of studio production techniques; things that would be hard to do in a live concert. If you like,
  you can build your entire presentation around one such small
  detail.
- “How did they do it?” Do some research on how the successful
  elements of the production were achieved, for example, by choice
  of unusual equipment or recording locations, through novel
  recording or editing techniques, etc.
- If available information is sparse, speculate creatively. What
  _could_ the recording space have looked like? How _could_ they have
  achieved that unusual distortion on the vocals? It is not primarily
  important that you get this 100% right. What _is_ important is that
  you employ and train your aural awareness and imagination.

# Presentation

> Two students will present each Tuesday

Your in-class presentation should strictly be no longer than 10 minutes, so be sure to be concise! Do _not_ prepare any slides for your presentation, but bring along your analysis and a device to play your
sound example from (laptop, smartphone, mobile music player).

Start your presentation by playing that sound example, but only
after pointing out to the class which aspect of the recording you
would like them to listen. Use this as a starting point for your
discussion.

# Assessment Criteria

Your assignment will primarily be assessed in terms of the imagination and the attention to detail that you demonstrate in your
analysis. Try to verbalize what exactly you like about the production, and be imaginative in your conclusions as to how this might
have been achieved. While I want you to exhaust potential research
sources (such as interviews with the respective producer, YouTube
videos, etc.), a true lack of reliable information is not a problem per
se. A thorough analysis _by ear_ should be the focus of your efforts.
