title: "Final Presentation Instructions"
---

Present on the material in your final papers. Each student will have 20 minutes total for their presentations; 15 minutes for presenting and 5 minutes for questions and comments.

These presentations will be more organized and formal that our journal presentations we've been doing throughout the semester. A PowerPoint is required to show relevant points of interest along with diagrams demonstrating important facts about the recordings.

Instead of playing through each recording in full, you'll play edited clips of audio that demonstrate whatever point you're trying to make. At no point should a student need to search through a recording while the presentation is happening.
